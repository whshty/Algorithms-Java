# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## Explanation
The height of a tree can be found by just going left. Let a single node tree have height 0. Find the height h of the whole tree. If the whole tree is empty, i.e., has height -1, there are 0 nodes.

Otherwise check whether the height of the right subtree is just one less than that of the whole tree, meaning left and right subtree have the same height.

* If yes, then the last node on the last tree row is in the right subtree and the left subtree is a full tree of height h-1. So we take the 2^h-1 nodes of the left subtree plus the 1 root node plus recursively the number of nodes in the right subtree.
* If no, then the last node on the last tree row is in the left subtree and the right subtree is a full tree of height h-2. So we take the 2^(h-1)-1 nodes of the right subtree plus the 1 root node plus recursively the number of nodes in the left subtree.
